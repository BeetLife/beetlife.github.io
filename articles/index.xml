&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-ask-open-ended-questions&#34;&gt;1. Ask open-ended questions.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to ask open-ended questions in order to identify the other person&amp;rsquo;s position and interest. Open-ended questions invite a narrative and paints a more accurate picture of what the problem is. For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You SHOULD NOT say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;Do you regret your decision?
Do you want to compromise?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You SHOULD say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;How do you feel about your decision? (open-ended)

If I am willing to do [...],
what are you willing to do? (open-ended)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-focus-on-the-problem&#34;&gt;2. Focus on the problem.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose there is a dispute between over uncleaned dog poop in one neighbor&amp;rsquo;s lawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;Neighbor: This is not the first time your dog
made my life difficult! He also bit my
daughter last summer! That dog has to go!

You: Your daughter threw a rock at my dog!

Neighbor: That&#39;s a lie!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a heated conversation, it is highly likely that the conversation can get out of topic. In these situations, you should remind the parties in conflict or the person you are in conflict with to focus on particular issues. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;Your claim that my dog bit your daughter
last summer is a separate matter.
Let&#39;s focus on the poop problem first.
What do you want to do to resolve the
uncleaned dog poop?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-reframe-the-issue-and-praphrase-the-language&#34;&gt;3. Reframe the issue and praphrase the language.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paraphrasing inflamatory language and/or reframing the issue helps people focus on the problem at hand. For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;Neighbor: You lazy [expletive]! You don&#39;t care about other people!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, YOU SHOULD NOT SAY:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;So the issue for you is that [his/my] dog pooped on
your lawn and [he/I] didn&#39;t clean it up?&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YOU SHOULD SAY:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;If I understand correctly, the issue for you is
that [a] dog pooped in your lawn,
but [no one] cleaned it up. Is this correct?&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how using neutral language reframes the issue and moves towards a solution rather than more conflict. Another example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;Husband: You do not give me enough money!
Wife: Do I hear you correctly when you say you would
like me to increase my financial contribution to the household?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-react-positively&#34;&gt;4. React positively.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People involved in a dispute are generally frustrated or angry. It is highly likely that they will take that frustration or anger out on you. It is important for you not to take things personally and react positively. For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;Aggrieved Person: You think I&#39;m lying!
You&#39;re on his side!

You: What makes you think that?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing a calm non-defensive invitation for the aggrieved person to explain their position or how they feel about the situation provides you with an understanding of what their interests are and how to best resolve the issue at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-facilitate-an-interest-based-conversation-by-providing-reality-checks&#34;&gt;5. Facilitate an interest-based conversation by providing reality checks.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing a reality check may facilitate a solution when a person is unwilling to move from his/her position. Whenever a person threatens or demands for something unrealistic, replying with a challenge will create more animosity between you and the other person. For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;Person: I will sue you in court!
You: Go ahead!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, use open-ended questions that force the other person to reexamine the feasibility of their demands or threats. It also opens up a discussion about more reasonable options. For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;How will suing me stop dogs from pooping in your lawn?

How will suing me clean up the poop in your lawn?

How is the court going to enforce what you are proposing?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like using mnemonics to remember certain concepts. Next time you encounter conflict, remember to &lt;strong&gt;OFRRR&lt;/strong&gt; love! (1) open-ended question, (2) focus on the problem, (3) Reframe and paraphrase, (4) React positively, (5) Reality check!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Choose, Prepare and Store Bell Peppers</title>
      <link>https://beet.life/articles/how-to-prep-bell-pepper/</link>

&lt;h4 id=&#34;is-there-a-difference-between-different-colored-bell-peppers&#34;&gt;Is there a difference between different colored bell peppers?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green bell peppers are harvested before they are ripe. As green peppers mature, they turn yellow,
orange then red as they reach the peak of maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bell peppers are a great source of antioxidants, folate, potassium and vitamin C. However, each
color of pepper vary slightly in nutritional content and taste. For example, red bell peppers
have twice as much vitamin C, eleven times more beta carotene and nine times more lycopene than
green peppers because the pepper was left to mature on the plant. Orange, yellow and red peppers
also taste sweeter than the green ones. All whole medium peppers are around 24 calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-do-other-types-of-pepper-cost-more&#34;&gt;Why do other types of pepper cost more?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow, orange and red peppers cost more because they require more time
before they can be harvested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-do-i-choose-which-pepper-to-buy&#34;&gt;How do I choose which pepper to buy?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Color and taste is a matter of preference. When buying bell peppers, pick one that is shiny and firm. Avoid pale green peppers or peppers
that have shriveled skin or spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-do-i-prepare-bell-peppers-for-cooking-or-eating&#34;&gt;How do I prepare bell peppers for cooking or eating?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preparing bell peppers for cooking or eating is very easy. How you&amp;rsquo;re going to
cut the bell pepper will vary based on what you want to do with it, but it boils down to a few
steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div itemscope itemtype=&#34;https://schema.org/Recipe&#34;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&#34;bl-how-to-instructions&#34;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol itemprop=&#34;recipeInstructions&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ItemList&#34; itemprop=&#34;itemListOrder&#34; content=&#34;http://schema.org/ItemListOrderAscending&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps&#34;&gt;

&lt;li itemprop=&#34;itemListElement&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps__step&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wash the pepper in cold water and use a knife to cut the pepper lengthwise in half
(from the stem down).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li itemprop=&#34;itemListElement&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps__step&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside you&amp;rsquo;ll see the core of the pepper with little seeds. Remove the core and the seeds.&lt;/p&gt;



















&lt;img itemprop=&#34;image&#34; class=&#34;bl-img lazyload&#34; src=&#34;https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-bell-pepper/20160308-DSC_0067-full@1x.jpg&#34; data-srcset=&#34;https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-bell-pepper/20160308-DSC_0067-mobile@1x.jpg 435w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-bell-pepper/20160308-DSC_0067-mobile@2x.jpg 870w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-bell-pepper/20160308-DSC_0067-full@1x.jpg 876w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-bell-pepper/20160308-DSC_0067-mobile@3x.jpg 1305w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-bell-pepper/20160308-DSC_0067-full@2x.jpg 1752w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-bell-pepper/20160308-DSC_0067-full@3x.jpg 2628w&#34; data-sizes=&#34;(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px&#34; alt=&#34;Image demonstrating the previous recipe step instructions&#34; srcset=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34;&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li itemprop=&#34;itemListElement&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps__step&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trim the top and bottom of the pepper. Make sure you trim the stem off completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li itemprop=&#34;itemListElement&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps__step&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slice, chop, dice or julienne and incorporate into your favorite dishes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4 id=&#34;where-should-i-store-my-peppers&#34;&gt;Where should I store my peppers?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storing bell peppers in the refrigerator will prolong its freshness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-do-i-incorporate-bell-peppers-into-my-diet&#34;&gt;How do I incorporate bell peppers into my diet?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bell peppers are versatile. They can be eaten raw, roasted, grilled or sauteed.
My favorite is roasting them at a high temperature (around 450 to 500 degrees) because it brings
out the sweetness in them!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Three Simple Rules When Resolving Or Dealing With Conflicts</title>
      <link>https://beet.life/articles/three-simple-rules-when-resolving-or-dealing-with-conflicts/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2016 09:37:24 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://beet.life/articles/three-simple-rules-when-resolving-or-dealing-with-conflicts/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts arise when a person&amp;rsquo;s needs are not met and is often triggered by fear, sense of unfairness, and difference in opinions, values or attitudes. People quarrel over chores, finances, timelines, territory, etc. You name it, people have fought about it. Here are three simple rules to keep in mind when resolving or dealing with a conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-the-fair-solution-is-not-always-the-best-solution-a-good-solution-to-a-problem-is-one-that-addresses-the-concerns-and-needs-of-each-party-in-conflict&#34;&gt;1. The &amp;lsquo;fair&amp;rsquo; solution is not always the best solution. A good solution to a problem is one that addresses the concerns and needs of each party in conflict.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of dividing fault or splitting the difference equally as the fairest way of resolving a conflict is flawed because opposing parties usually do not want the same things even though they say they do. Consider this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two daughters are fighting over the last lemon in the kitchen. Each say they want the lemon. They bicker for ten minutes and don&amp;rsquo;t listen to each other. The mother says, &amp;ldquo;split the lemon.&amp;rdquo; Both daughters do not want to split the lemon. The bickering goes on. The mother forces them to split the lemon in half. Both daughters walk away unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without addressing each of her daughter&amp;rsquo;s concerns, the mother failed to realize that one daughter wanted to make lemonade and the other needed the lemon zest of a whole lemon to cook her favorite dish. Although both said they wanted the whole lemon, their needs differed. With this new information, it is clear that the best solution is to give one daughter lemon juice and the other lemon zest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-the-more-effective-way-of-solving-a-dispute-is-to-listen-carefully-to-each-person-and-use-the-information-they-give-you-to-address-their-needs&#34;&gt;2. The more effective way of solving a dispute is to listen carefully to each person and use the information they give you to address their needs.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, in a heated conversation, each party&amp;rsquo;s needs and wants will not be easily apparent. Deescalate the situation by making the speaker feel understood. Ask questions like &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;In my understanding, you said you want [&amp;hellip;] Is this correct?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. A question like this is useful because it reiterates what the speaker is saying and asking the speaker to reaffirm whether or not you understood him/her correctly. Not only does it deescalate a heated situation, it gives the speaker a chance to think about his/her needs by affirming or negating what you said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-mind-your-language-state-your-wants-and-needs-avoid-talking-in-absolutes&#34;&gt;3. Mind your language! State your wants and needs. Avoid talking in absolutes.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only siths deal with absolutes. Don&amp;rsquo;t use sentences like these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;You never take the trash out.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;You always forget to pick up the kids from school.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;You always fail to meet the deadline.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You + Absolute + Action&lt;/strong&gt; conveys blame rather than cooperation. It escalates an already heated conversation. It may feel like the person &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; did what you asked or &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; failed to do what you wanted, but it won&amp;rsquo;t do you any good to verbalize that. You won&amp;rsquo;t get what you want if you speak in absolutes because it invites defensive action rather than cooperation. It steers the conversation away from the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;I + need/want + person to do [&amp;hellip;]&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; instead. This is more effective because it conveys cooperation and invites action rather than a defensive act/reaction. For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;I want you to take the trash out every week.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I need you to be consistent when picking the kids up from school.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I want to know ahead of time if you are having a hard time meeting the deadline.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you state your wants and needs, you are opening up a conversation and letting the other person know clearly what you want them to do. There is no shaming or blaming involved; therefore, the other person is more receptive to coming up with a solution to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Boil Pasta</title>
      <link>https://beet.life/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 14:51:39 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://beet.life/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pasta comes in different shapes and sizes. It is a staple in Italian cooking and is usually made with some sort of flour and eggs. Thankfully, many supermarkets now carry vegan options! We often use
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.explore-asian.com/bean-pasta/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Explore Asian Bean Pastas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because they are certified vegan and contain between 20 to 25 grams of protein per serving! They can be found in your local Stop &amp;amp; Shop or Wholefoods. Wholefoods (and its 365 Everyday Value brand) also carry their own vegan pastas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boiling pasta is VERY easy. All you need is water, oil, a pot and a stove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div itemscope itemtype=&#34;https://schema.org/Recipe&#34;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&#34;bl-how-to-instructions&#34;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol itemprop=&#34;recipeInstructions&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ItemList&#34; itemprop=&#34;itemListOrder&#34; content=&#34;http://schema.org/ItemListOrderAscending&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps&#34;&gt;

&lt;li itemprop=&#34;itemListElement&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps__step&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn stove on medium heat. Add water to a pot large enough to hold the type of pasta you are planning on cooking. Wait for water to boil. It usually takes about 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



















&lt;img itemprop=&#34;image&#34; class=&#34;bl-img lazyload&#34; src=&#34;https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0587-full@1x.jpg&#34; data-srcset=&#34;https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0587-mobile@1x.jpg 435w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0587-mobile@2x.jpg 870w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0587-full@1x.jpg 876w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0587-mobile@3x.jpg 1305w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0587-full@2x.jpg 1752w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0587-full@3x.jpg 2628w&#34; data-sizes=&#34;(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px&#34; alt=&#34;Image demonstrating the previous recipe step instructions&#34; srcset=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34;&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li itemprop=&#34;itemListElement&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps__step&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a teaspoon of oil (we prefer using extra virgin olive oil) to prevent pasta
from sticking to the pot and each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li itemprop=&#34;itemListElement&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps__step&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the pasta. Cook time depends on the type of pasta and brand you are
using. Rice, whole grain, gluten-free, and bean pastas tend to cook much faster than regular ones.&lt;/p&gt;



















&lt;img itemprop=&#34;image&#34; class=&#34;bl-img lazyload&#34; src=&#34;https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0593-banner-full@1x.jpg&#34; data-srcset=&#34;https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0593-banner-mobile@1x.jpg 435w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0593-banner-mobile@2x.jpg 870w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0593-banner-full@1x.jpg 1084w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0593-banner-mobile@3x.jpg 1305w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0593-banner-full@2x.jpg 2168w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-boil-pasta/20160229-DSC_0593-banner-full@3x.jpg 3252w&#34; data-sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1084px) 100vw, 1084px&#34; alt=&#34;Image demonstrating the previous recipe step instructions&#34; srcset=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34;&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>How To Choose, Prepare and Store Asparagus</title>
      <link>https://beet.life/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/</link>

&lt;p&gt;We love asparagus! We try to incorporate it into the dishes we cook as much as we can.
It can be grilled, steamed, baked, sauteed, boiled and even microwaved! A medium spear that is
5 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to 7 inches long is around 3 calories. It&amp;rsquo;s rich in vitamin K which helps prevent arteries
from hardening (a common factor in heart failure). It also helps build stronger bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;thick-or-thin&#34;&gt;Thick or Thin?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What size you buy is a matter of preference. The thin ones are sweeter while the
thicker ones have a stronger asparagus flavor because it&amp;rsquo;s more mature. The thick ones are ideal
for roasting because they are more tender. Thin ones are ideal for soups because they contain less
fibrous material. The key is to look for firm stems with a bright green color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-do-i-store-asparagus&#34;&gt;How do I store asparagus?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not wash before storing. Store in the refrigerator to keep fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-do-i-prepare-asparagus-for-cooking-or-eating&#34;&gt;How do I prepare asparagus for cooking or eating?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preparing asparagus for cooking is very easy. There are two ways we like to use: &lt;em&gt;Peeling and Cutting&lt;/em&gt;. The bottom of an asparagus stalk can be very rough.&lt;/p&gt;

























&lt;img itemprop=&#34;image&#34; class=&#34;bl-img bl-img-margin lazyload&#34; src=&#34;https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160308-DSC_0019-full@1x.jpg&#34; data-srcset=&#34;https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160308-DSC_0019-mobile@1x.jpg 435w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160308-DSC_0019-full@1x.jpg 533w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160308-DSC_0019-mobile@2x.jpg 870w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160308-DSC_0019-full@2x.jpg 1066w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160308-DSC_0019-mobile@3x.jpg 1305w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160308-DSC_0019-full@3x.jpg 1600w&#34; data-sizes=&#34;(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px&#34; alt=&#34;asparagus bottom&#34; srcset=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34;&gt;






&lt;p&gt;Cutting or peeling prevents stringiness when the asparagus is cooked. It also cuts down on cooking time. In our experience, cutting works best for thin asparagus while peeling works best for thick ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li itemprop=&#34;itemListElement&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps__step&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After washing, use a vegetable peeler to peel the outer layer of the lower stem of the asparagus.&lt;/p&gt;



















&lt;img itemprop=&#34;image&#34; class=&#34;bl-img lazyload&#34; src=&#34;https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160228-DSC_0482-full@1x.jpg&#34; data-srcset=&#34;https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160228-DSC_0482-mobile@1x.jpg 435w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160228-DSC_0482-mobile@2x.jpg 870w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160228-DSC_0482-full@1x.jpg 876w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160228-DSC_0482-mobile@3x.jpg 1305w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160228-DSC_0482-full@2x.jpg 1752w, https://beet.life/images/articles/how-to-prep-asparagus/20160228-DSC_0482-full@3x.jpg 2628w&#34; data-sizes=&#34;(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px&#34; alt=&#34;Image demonstrating the previous recipe step instructions&#34; srcset=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34;&gt;

      <title>What is Garam Masala?</title>
      <link>https://beet.life/articles/what-is-garam-masala/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 14:51:39 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://beet.life/articles/what-is-garam-masala/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Garam masala is a ground spice blend used in South Asian and Southeast
Asian dishes. The spices used vary depending on the region and many have adopted their own versions.
The common spices used are cardamon, clove, cumin, cinnamon, coriander, peppercorn, and nutmeg.
Some add fennel seed, nigella seeds, dry mango, mace, anistar, different types of chili and even
mustard seeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uses:&lt;/strong&gt; It can be used in stews, soups, marinades, salad dressings, as a rub, in boiled rice
and even in desserts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage:&lt;/strong&gt; Using a tin can with double lids is the best way to keep ground spices fresh. We use
tea tin metal containers for our spices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The garam masala spice we use is store bought. It has coriander, red chili, cumin, clove, anistar, mace, fennel, black pepper, bay leaves, cinnamon, dry mango, salt and clove leaves. However, you can also make your own spice blend by using the common spices mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div itemscope itemtype=&#34;https://schema.org/Recipe&#34;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&#34;bl-how-to-instructions&#34;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol itemprop=&#34;recipeInstructions&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ItemList&#34; itemprop=&#34;itemListOrder&#34; content=&#34;http://schema.org/ItemListOrderAscending&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps&#34;&gt;

&lt;li itemprop=&#34;itemListElement&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps__step&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roast equal parts of each spice except for nutmeg and clove in a dry skillet on medium heat.
Use &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; parts of nutmeg and clove. If you want to add some heat, add cayenne, dried ginger or
red pepper flakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li itemprop=&#34;itemListElement&#34; class=&#34;bl-recipe-steps__step&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After roasting for about 3 minutes, grind them in a spice grinder. Let it cool and store in a
sealable tin can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-we-got-started&#34;&gt;How we got started.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of starting a blog arose during one of our morning runs at the
end of 2015. We had gotten engaged after seven years (and a cat child) together and were going
through a transitional phase in our careers. We spent a lot of time reading and thinking about
health, nutrition, and food so we decided to create a blog together where we could share our passion for vegan food, photography, recipe development and programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;our-blog-features-vegan-plant-based-recipes&#34;&gt;Our blog features vegan/plant-based recipes.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition from being an omnivore to herbivore was not an easy one. We were used to cooking
meat-heavy dishes with vegetable sides so cooking dishes where vegetables were the stars of the
meal was difficult. After months of research and repeated experiments in the kitchen, we found
ways to make well-balanced and guilt-free meals. This process, although painful at times,
helped us get to know what type of foods worked best for our bodies and helped us become healthier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;our-blog-features-other-articles-not-related-to-food&#34;&gt;Our blog features other articles not related to food.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The members of the Beet Life have varied interests that
we also want to explore in this blog. That can include product reviews,
behavioral economics, philosophy, technology and pets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris is an engineer. He studied human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence. He values efficiency and logical consistency. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t think eating animals or animal-based products makes sense because it causes suffering to other sentient beings, degradation of the environment, and health problems. Why eat animals when vegan food is so delicious?! When he&amp;rsquo;s not food tasting, Chris is looking at stock charts, working on various coding projects, weight lifting, running or playing strategy games. Chris is also the co-founder of &lt;a href=&#34;http://sportsofboston.com/&#34;&gt;Sports of Boston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/frostly&#34;&gt;Frostly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
